# Game-Guess-the-number-
A simple game, written in Python.
This is my first game, where I've tried to use beginner's skills of Python.
To play a game, you should install Python ver. 3.xx from offical site, then get a ".py" file from this repository.
Call the command line in Windows (Win+D from keyboard), write "cmd" then go to folder, where you saved ".py" file (to relocate from folders check "cmd commands" in Google (For examlpe: cd, dir, etc.)
Write in command line next text:
python Guess_the_number.py 
and press Enter.
Then follow commands in command line.
Enjoy. :)

PS. Commands written in Russian language.
